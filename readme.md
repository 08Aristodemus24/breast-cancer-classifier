# **STILL IN PRODUCTION**

# Usage
create virtual or conda environment (if conda use conda create -n <env name> python=3.10) enter environment (if conda use conda activate <env name>) in current working directory containing requirements.txt use pip install -r requirements.txt

## to implement:
- <u> build baseline model </u>
- build better tuned model
- explore data and see graphs
- extract the cost of the training of a model at the last epoch because by then weights are optimized
- extract cross validation cost using model at last epoch as well since by then weights are optimized
